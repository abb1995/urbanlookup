"API = application programming interfaceAn API is a series of functions
   that programs can use to make the operating system do their dirty
   work. Using Windows APIs, for example, a program can open windows,
   files, and message boxes--as well as perform more complicated tasks--by

   that deal with telephony, messaging, and other issues."
